# React Native User Profile Viewer

A sleek and modern React Native application that displays user profiles with a beautiful UI, animations, and navigation. This app fetches user data from an API and allows users to navigate through profiles with "Next" and "Previous" buttons, featuring smooth animations using `react-native-reanimated`.

## Features

- **Modern UI Design**: Gradient background, shadowed cards, and a circular avatar for a polished look.
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in animations (`FadeInDown`, `FadeInUp`) for avatar, name, email, and user info cards, triggered on initial load and when navigating between users.
- **User Navigation**: "Next" and "Previous" buttons to cycle through user profiles with re-triggered animations.
- **Password Toggle**: Show/hide password functionality with an eye icon.
- **Robust Data Handling**: Fallbacks for missing data (e.g., avatar, name, email) to ensure a seamless experience.
- **Loading State**: Displays a loading indicator (`ActivityIndicator`) while fetching user data.
